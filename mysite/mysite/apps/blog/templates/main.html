          Gülhane Park (Turkish: Gülhane Parkı, "Rosehouse Park"; from Persian:
          گلخانه Gulkhāna, "house of flowers") is a historical urban park in the
          Eminönü district of Istanbul, Turkey; it is adjacent to and on the
          grounds of the Topkapı Palace. The south entrance of the park sports
          one of the larger gates of the palace. It is the oldest and one of the
          most expansive public parks in Istanbul.

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Hanami (花見, "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the transient beauty of flowers;
          flowers ("hana") are in this case almost always referring to those of the cherry ("sakura") or, less
          frequently, plum ("ume") trees.[1] From the end of March to early May, cherry trees bloom all over Japan,[2]
          and around the first of February on the island of Okinawa.[3] The blossom forecast (桜前線, sakura-zensen)
          "cherry blossom front" is announced each year by the weather bureau, and is watched carefully by those
          planning hanami as the blossoms only last a week or two.

        <p class="lead">
          Dandelions are thought to have evolved about 30 million years ago in Eurasia. Fossil seeds of Taraxacum
          tanaiticum have been recorded from the Pliocene of southern Russia.[26] Dandelions have been used by humans
          for food and as an herb for much of recorded history. They were well known to ancient Egyptians, Greeks and
          Romans, and are recorded to have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over a thousand years. The
          plant was used as food and medicine by Native Americans. Dandelions were brought to North America on the
          Mayflower for their medicinal benefits.
